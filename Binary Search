Searching is an important day to day operation and even in many software applications,
we frequently search for data.  

â—» SEARCHING
It is a method to find some relevant information in a data set.


â—» LINEAR SEARCHING
The algorithm of linearly searching through the array is called Linear Search!

ðŸš€ BINARY SEARCH
      â–« Binary Search is an algorithm that can be used to search an element in sorted dataset.
      â–« By Sorted, we mean that the elements will either be in a natural ascending or descending order.
                                    10, 20, 30, 40, 50
                                     ( Sorted array)

s  mid  e
â–« s is the start index
â–« e is the end index
â–« mid is the midpoint

The element you are looking for key

BINARY SEARCH
â–« Binary Search is a DIVIDE and CONQUER algorithm.
â–« It divides the ARRAY into TWO HALVES and tries to find the element k in one or the other half, not both. 
  It keeps on doing this untill we either ind the element or the array is exhausted.
