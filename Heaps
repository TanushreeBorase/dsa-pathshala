              INTRODUCTION

◻ Heaps are implemented using priority queue in c++. 

◻ Maintains an ordering among elements.

◻ Priority queues are built on the top to the max heap and uses array or vector as an internal structure.


              TYPES OF HEAPS

              ✅ Max-Heap
              ✅ Min-Heap

                
                MAX HEAP
◻ The queue maintains the elements in decreasing order.
// declaring a max-heap of integers

priority_queue<int> q2;

// Important Note: default is max heap

                MIN HEAP
// declaring a min-heap of integers

priority_queue <int>, vector<int>, greater<int> q1;
