→ Sorting Algorithm 
It is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. 

→ Selection sort 
It is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) 
element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 

→ Bubble sort 
- traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
- In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
- This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.

→ Insertion sort
It is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. 
The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed 
at the correct position in the sorted part.
