Terminologies:
Parent Node: The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node.

Child Node: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node. 

Root Node: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node is called the root node.

Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes.

Ancestor of a Node: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node are called Ancestors of that node. 

Descendant: Any successor node on the path from the leaf node to that node. 

Sibling: Children of the same parent node are called siblings.

Level of a node: The count of edges on the path from the root node to that node. The root node has level 0.

nternal node: A node with at least one child is called Internal Node.

Neighbour of a Node: Parent or child nodes of that node are called neighbors of that node.

Subtree: Any node of the tree along with its descendant.



Basic Operation Of Tree Data Structure:
Create – create a tree in the data structure.

Insert − Inserts data in a tree.

Search − Searches specific data in a tree to check whether it is present or not.

Traversal:
Preorder Traversal – perform Traveling a tree in a pre-order manner in the data structure.

In order Traversal – perform Traveling a tree in an in-order manner.

Post-order Traversal –perform Traveling a tree in a post-order manner.
