DSA is defined as a combination of two separate yet interrelated topics – 
                          Data Structure 
                              and 
                          Algorithms.

DATA STRUCTURES 🌞
--> A data structure is defined as a particular data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. 
--> The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. 
--> An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.

ALGORITHMS  🌞
It is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.

Why should you learn dsa? 🧐
--> Every basic, as well as advanced, 
💻  software and internet service
💻  searching a topic on the internet,
use data structure or algorithm to implement.

DSA is the heart of root programming ❤
